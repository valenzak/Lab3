      "Significance: This is a code to extract gun homicide rates in various countries.  Maybe I could later pair this information with some sort of gun rights index to try to make conclusions on whether more gun rights means more gun homicides.  I currently have no pre-concieved notion of the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Problems: First, I tried writing a code to extract all crime incidences around UW reported by UWPD.  The html was inconsistant, however, and I gave up after having to set the code to look for something else after every other incident.  With the gun homicides table I ended up using, there was no easy way to make a list of dictionaries, for some reason.  I don't know why, it was easy for the group project and not for this one.  I thought writing two seperate, side by side columns HAD to be done with a list of dictionaries, so put a lot of time into trying to get this to work out.  Then I realized I should try it another way: I made a list of lists instead.  I got this to work fairly quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Borrowings: I borrowed a lot from our group scraping assignment, but had to modify all of it heavily in this case.  I googled how to write to lists to a csv file, and used a pretty large number of websites to decide what would work best for what I'm trying to do.  I didn't talk to anyone about anything technical during this assignment, though Cole and I talked briefly about our respective topics.  Really, I wanted to see what I could do on my own (albeit with the help of the internet), and I'm proud of this assignment for exactly that reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time spent:  When it's late at night on Sunday and Monday (I was REALLY behind due to midterms, etc. this week), I get very little done.  I worked for six hours on the UW crime thing, and subsequently realizing it wouldn't work, and trying to get something started with the Gun Homicide thing.  Wednesday in class, I was pleased with how quickly I was able to make lists of the rows I wanted.  Wednesday afternoon, I fiddled with making a list of dictionaries for 3 or more hours (I didn't realize I was so tired/ineffective).  Thursday afternoon/evening, I abandoned the dictionaries idea, and got the csv file written exactly the way I wanted it in about two hours or so.  15+ hours of work in total."
